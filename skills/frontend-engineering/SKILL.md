# Frontend engineering

Read AGENTS.md, the project design contract, scripts, compiler config and framework entry points. Use ui-foundation/ui-web for design and frontend-verification for execution evidence. Select Skills explicitly in zt.json; sync does not resolve their dependencies.

1. Map the feature from route/server boundary through validation, state owner and components. Follow [boundaries](references/boundaries.md); keep business/deployment assumptions local.
2. Reuse semantic tokens, local fonts and component variants. Define missing semantic roles, including destructive actions, in the project contract without copying another product's values.
3. Validate unknown runtime input using the existing schema mechanism. Preserve retry and input; do not expand a boundary improvement into an unrelated client/server rewrite.
4. Normalize supported preferences and render deterministic SSR defaults. Apply [preferences and localization](references/preferences-i18n.md) to hydration, persistence, errors and dialogs.
5. Preserve framework exports and native browser fallback. Run the compiler/build alongside strict ESLint; lint alone cannot validate routing or Worker deployment.
6. Report changed decisions, affected states, exact checks and uncertainty. Visual baselines and performance budgets are deferred.

## Generic shared shell

`@ztd-me/frontend` provides reusable chrome, validated non-sensitive appearance/UI locale and explicit persistence mechanisms. Its defaults are Neutral + System and six palettes. Consumers supply their own brand, footer/repository/contact content, cookie name/domain/Secure choice, optional storage notification key and business slots. Tools must not select policy through project names or hostnames, enforce a repository-host allowlist, or carry legacy storage mappings. Remove rejected legacy mappings entirely rather than moving them into consumers; old business/auth storage stays untouched. Shared domain cookies are untrusted UI input. Consumers own development/preview isolation, deployment, authentication, account state and business navigation. Generic shell guidance grants no sync ownership over project components or production files. Preserve native strict gates and upstream licenses. Final integration requires a promoted exact registry version and fresh-consumer verification; staging or local packed evidence alone does not establish public installation.
